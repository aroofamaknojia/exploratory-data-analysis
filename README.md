Spotify Top 2000s Song List Exploratory Data Analysis 
Conducted an exploratory data analysis over Spotify's Top 2000's Song Lists

Visualizations I created:
1. Histogram for popularity frequencies
2. Scatterplots comparing characteristics and popularity
3. Correlation Matrix of all the song characteristics
4. Line Plots of song characteristics over time
5. Horizontal Bar Chart with the number of songs per artist on the chart
6. Pie Chart of the number of songs released per year by Queen
7. Bar chart of the popularity rankings of the top artists on the chart
8. Pie chart of the genre distribution of the top 20 artists with the most songs on the chart
9. Treemap of the top 35 most popular genres on Spotify based on dataset
10. Bar chart of the number of songs per year on the chart
